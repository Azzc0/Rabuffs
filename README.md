# RABuffs

An addon to track raid wide and your personal buffs and personal weapon enchants.

It provides a panel of clickable buttons that light up when a buff is found.

You can click on the panel to buff up, which saves space from your action bars.

A lot of the functionality is also available in macros via the /rab and /rabq commands.
