# WARNING
This version is not backwards compatible with the original - it uses a new format in the WTF file as the original was very impractical to work with.

I would recommend backing up your WTF folder or SavedVariables\Rabuffs.lua in case you ever want to revert.

# Pepo Changes

- All buffs can be toggled self only rather than having two versions
- Options for hiding in combat and hiding buffs that are active
- Reorganized all the buff menus to make it easier to find things
- Made settings window draggable
- Ability to ignore player names on specific buffs
- Better identification of buffs with the same texture/tooltip

# RABuffs

An addon to track raid wide and your personal buffs and personal weapon enchants.

It provides a panel of clickable buttons that light up when a buff is found.

You can click on the panel to buff up, which saves space from your action bars.

A lot of the functionality is also available in macros via the /rab and /rabq commands.
